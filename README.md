## 🌐 Overview

**HopeVid** is a comprehensive, preventive, and personalized web application designed to combat COVID-19 by "raising the line" of healthcare capacity. Focused on tracking and escalation, it provides a minimalist interface for users of all age groups to monitor their health, consult professionals, and stay informed.

### 🛡️ Core Idea: STAE-C

We implemented the **STAE-C (Systematic Tracking and Escalation Checking)** framework to streamline the pandemic response:

1.  **Screening**: AI Chatbot-led initial symptom assessment.
2.  **Referral**: Visual health vital analysis and doctor recommendation for high-risk users.
3.  **Consultation**: Seamless virtual interaction with medical professionals.
4.  **Testing**: Automated connection to pathology labs for sample collection.
5.  **Escalation**: Secure data sharing with designated authorities only upon positive results.
